    <p>Telekinetic power involves kinetic energy, but a sufficiently
    sophisticated grip on motion can be used to agitate the molecules of an
    inanimate object and cause it to melt or burst into flame. Similar focus can
    chill or freeze such substances.</p><p>Applying <em>Thermokinesis</em> to a
    target requires that the adept Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action.
    <em>Thermokinesis</em> cannot affect objects larger than the adept could
    lift with their <em>Telekinetic Manipulation</em>.</p><p>As with other
    telekinetic powers, this ability does not work on objects being held or used
    by intelligent creatures. Non-sentient robots or other objects with hit
    points take 1d12 damage per level of Telekinesis skill each time this
    technique is applied to them.</p>
