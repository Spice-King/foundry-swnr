  description: >-
    <p>The adept may Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to direct
    telekinetic force toward an object or person within unaided visual range or
    with tactile contact with the psychic. This force isn’t responsive enough to
    be effective as a weapon without further refinement of technique, and cannot
    cause damage to living or mobile targets. If used to crush or harm immobile
    unliving objects, it does 1d6 damage per skill level of the psychic per
    round of focus. Objects move at 20 meters per round when moved
    telekinetically.</p><p>A telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple
    rounds without expending further actions, such as holding a metal platform
    in place under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot again activate this
    technique on a second object until they release the first.</p><p>Level-0:
    The psychic can exert force as if with one hand and their own
    strength.</p><p>Level-1: The psychic can manipulate objects as if with both
    hands and can lift up to two hundred kilograms with this
    ability.</p><p>Level-2: The psychic can lift or manipulate up to four
    hundred kilograms and smash a human-sized hole in structures of light wooden
    construction or lighter as a Main Action.</p><p>Level-3: The psychic can
    manipulate up to eight hundred kilograms and can affect as many individual
    objects at once as they have Telekinesis skill levels.</p><p>Level-4: The
    psychic can manipulate up to a metric ton and can smash human-sized holes in
    TL4-constructed exterior walls, light stone walls, or similar barriers as a
    Main Action.</p>
