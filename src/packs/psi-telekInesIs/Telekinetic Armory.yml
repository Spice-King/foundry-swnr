    <p>The adept may Commit Effort as an On Turn action to create both weapons
    and armor out of telekinetic force. These weapons are treated as tech level
    4 and act as a rifle or any advanced melee weapon. Attack rolls can use
    either Dexterity, Wisdom, or Constitution modifiers, and may use the
    Telekinesis skill as the combat skill.</p><p>Armor may be created as part of
    this power, granting the psychic a base Armor Class equal to 15 plus their
    Telekinesis skill level. This armor does not stack with conventional armor,
    but Dexterity or shields modify it as usual. The gear continues to exist as
    long as the psychic chooses to leave the Effort committed, and they may be
    invisible or visible at the psychic’s discretion.</p>
