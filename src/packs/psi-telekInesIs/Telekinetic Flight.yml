    and may extend this effect to up to a half-dozen unresisting, human-sized
    allies within 30 meters. While flying, the psychic can move at twice their
    normal movement rate in any direction They can plunge earthward at up to
    terminal velocity without harm, and even orbital insertions are survivable
    with this power if a vacc suit is available or the <em>Pressure Field</em>
