  description: >-
    Thunder guns are named for the basso vibrations caused by their operation, a
    sound that can be felt as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This
    two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid, randomized disruptions
    in a target that increase the chance of complete structural collapse. If a
    thunder gun hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an
    extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage always applies to inanimate
    targets.
