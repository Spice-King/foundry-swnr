  description: >-
    Thermal pistols and their larger, two-handed plasma projector cousins
    replace the beam of a laser with a small sphere of magnetically-shaped
    plasma. The spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than a laser
    beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not
    affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in
    operation.
