  description: >-
    Shear rifles are the product of a relatively few functioning pretech
    manufactories. These weapons use miniaturized grav projectors to create
    dangerous repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart along
    perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles are completely silent in operation.
