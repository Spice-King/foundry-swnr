  description: >-
    Bows are uncommon weapons in the far future, though some lostworlder
    barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated “conversion bows” use
    special materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into a force
    field “glazing” around the arrow, improving penetration. Bows can be
    reloaded with a Move action, or faster if the Gunslinger focus is applied.
