  description: >-
    Grenade users always roll to attack AC 10. On a miss, the grenade lands 1d10
    meters away from the target in a random direction. Hit or miss, the grenade
    then explodes for 2d6 damage to all targets within 5 meters. Victims are
    allowed an Evasion save for half damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage
    for each point of AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with the Exert skill
    instead of Shoot, if desired.
