  description: >-
    Combat rifles are favored by the militaries of tech level 3 worlds, trading
    some of the often-unnecessary range and penetration of a conventional rifle
    for a larger ammunition capacity and burst fire capabilities. On more
    strait-laced worlds such military weaponry is often illegal for civilians to
    possess.
