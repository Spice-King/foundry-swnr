  description: >-
    Crude pistols and muskets represent the rawest and most primitive forms of
    gunpowder weaponry, usually makeshift weapons improvised by criminals or the
    desperate. Reloading a crude pistol or a musket requires two rounds instead
    of one. Revolvers are quite popular on frontier worlds, as the weapons are
    extremely reliable and can be repaired and manufactured even by primitive
    metallurgists. Some revolver variants are specially built to handle
    atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons.
