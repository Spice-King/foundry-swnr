  description: >-
    Laser pistols and laser rifles are the most common type of energy weapon,
    though pistols are considerably less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech
    used in the sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of death or
    noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light. The phased multifrequency
    beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud
    of thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or sand can seriously
    degrade the beam, applying up to a -4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in
    half.
