  description: >-
    Sniper rifles are designed to be exceptionally effective at dropping
    unsuspecting targets at long range. Aside from the additional effective
    range of a sniper rifle, any target it mortally wounds via an execution
    attack will die instantly, with no chance for stabilization. The execution
    attack must qualify according to the terms on page 52. If the rifle is used
    outside of such conditions, it has no special qualities.
