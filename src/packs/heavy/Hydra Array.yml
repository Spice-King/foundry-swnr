  description: >-
    Hydra arrays sequence a number of missile launchers to fire at once. The
    gunner designates up to three targets and can then make three rolls to hit
    divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner to
    roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target.
    Thus, if all three volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them
    hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the best result. A volley
    from the array costs 150 credits.
