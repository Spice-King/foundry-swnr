  description: >-
    Wheatcutter belts are one of several different antipersonnel measures often
    installed on gravtanks and other fighting vehicles. When triggered, a belt
    of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side of the
    vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that side of the vehicle must
    make an Evasion save for half damage. Those within 20 meters take half
    damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts
    do not ignore a vehicleâ€™s Armor like other Heavy weapons do. Reloading a
    wheatcutter belt costs 200 credits per round.
