  description: >-
    Heavy machine guns represent a large family of air- or water-cooled
    projectile weapons that are usually fed with belts of linked ammunition.
    HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced firing position for effective
    results. An HMG magazine contains enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing,
    but each round of firing eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition.
