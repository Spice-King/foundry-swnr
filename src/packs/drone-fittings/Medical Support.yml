    The drone can be loaded with up to a dozen units of medication, whether stim
    doses, lazarus patches, or less benevolent substances. It can launch a
    medication through a remote injector at a target within ten meters in lieu
    of a weapon attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while
    hostiles require a normal hit roll. The drone is treated as having Heal-0
    skill or the active pilot's Heal skill, whichever is higher.
