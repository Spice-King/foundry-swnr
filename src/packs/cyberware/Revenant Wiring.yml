    One of the more grotesque results of late pretech augmentation research,
    revenant wiring permeates the user's body with a web of supplementary limb
    actuators and sensor clusters. In combat, the user may designate up to a
    half-dozen targets to the system's braked micro-AI. If the user goes
    unconscious or is killed, the micro-AI will engage the limb actuators to
    keep fighting, even if the user is nothing more than a ragged mass of
    mangled tissue. The micro-AI is not brilliant, but it is capable of
    negotiating most terrain and dealing with physical impediments to killing
    the designated targets. The actuators have power to keep operating for 3d4
    rounds, or until the wearer takes 25 more hit points of damage, whichever
    comes first. The stress produced by revenant wiring makes it much more
    difficult to revive a downed user with Lazarus patches or biopsionics; all
    revivification chances are half normal.
