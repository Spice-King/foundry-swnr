    The user's canines or fingernails are altered to allow for the injection of
    one of two types of poison. If the user attempts to inject an unsuspecting
    victim they are already touching, the attempt is automatically successful.
    If the victim is wary or in combat, they can only be affected if they are
    unarmored and the user succeeds in a Punch attack roll. On a success, the
    victim must make a Physical saving throw at -2 or be incapacitated by the
    poison, dying in 1d6 rounds or being incapacitated for 1d6 hours at the
    user's discretion. Each poison attack adds 2 System Strain to the user.
