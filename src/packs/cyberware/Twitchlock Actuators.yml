  description: >-
    Neural override fibers are woven into the user's hands and arms and linked
    to a perceptual modulator implanted at the base of the user's brain stem.
    When presented with a direct exercise of hand-eye coordination, the
    twitchlock can be engaged to produce superhuman accuracy and precision. Any
    attack roll or skill check reliant chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can
    be rerolled, though the power surge inflicts two points of System Strain on
    the user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this cyberware. While
    the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when engaged, the overrides fuzz
    ordinary nerve impulses and reduce the user's Dexterity modifier by 1 when
    active. Activating or deactivating the cyberware requires a Main Action.
