  description: >-
    An intricate interweaving of microcapillaries and backup organs is
    implanted in the subject's torso and spinal column. These overrides can
    stabilize the user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A
    user reduced to 0 hit points is automatically stabilized, as if a Lazarus
    patch had been successfully applied to them, assuming that a patch could
    have saved them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere with the
    ordinary operation of the user's organs, however, and the wearer's
    Constitution modifier is lowered by 1, with all the attendant consequences
    in loss of maximum hit points.
