  description: >-
    A fine subcutaneous reinforcement mesh provides significant protection
    against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to anything short of
    a medical examination. Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune to
    Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee weapons. The TL5 version of this
    implant grants even more protection, rendering the subject wholly immune to
    primitive weapons as if they were wearing powered armor.
