    A hair-fine mesh of almost im-perceptible wiring along the user's palms and
    fingers allow them to trigger brief, controlled bursts of electrical energy
    at targets within five meters. As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal
    damage to a successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it also allows
    the user to override and disable most electronic locks and security systems
    with a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering a burst and
    hacking a security system tax the user's biology; one System Strain point
    is gained with each attack or skill check.
