    Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body
    sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced medical
    services. After a week of alterations and treatments a subject's external
    appearance can be set within any human or near-human range, including full
    retinal and fingerprint matching to a desired target. The TL5 version of
    this treatment can involve extensive DNA reprogramming to change the
    subject at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable and allowing
    female-targeted shapes to bear offspring. This TL5 treatment is not
    reversible, and any further major alterations to the subject require
    further permanent System Strain.
