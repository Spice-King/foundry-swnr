    Most often found among military bot wranglers, civilians can also get a
    drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting of drones and
    other robotic units.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users of a link can issue
    commands to a drone as a Move action instead of a Main Action. A single
    drone can only receive one command per round,
    however.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from this ease of command,
    someone with an implanted rig can "look" through a piloted drone's sensors
    as an Instant action, and a drone is never considered to be out of control
    even if the pilot doesn't spend an action controlling it. A link can
    maintain a connection with one drone at a time, plus the user's Program
    skill.
