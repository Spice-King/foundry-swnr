    Some personnel need to be armed at all times without giving any indication
    of such. Improvised weaponry and conventional holdout weapons are useful
    enough against soft targets, but disabling a target in powered armor
    requires more. The details of the array vary from user to user, but usually
    act as advanced medium weapons that can be used with either Punch or Stab
    skills and at least one integral energy projector equal to a laser rifle,
    one that must be powered by an insertable type A power cell. Retracted body
    arsenals can be detected only by a medical examination.
