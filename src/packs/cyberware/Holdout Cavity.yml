  description: >-
    Usually implanted somewhere in the torso, a holdout cavity is a small
    recess shaped into the wearer's body and designed to be overlooked by most
    standard forms of medical or security scanning. It automatically defeats a
    security inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and even advanced
    tech requires careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it.
    The cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and is opened and
    shut by the user's mental command.
