    Ocular adjustments to the wearer allow them to see clearly at any light
    level short of perfect darkness, in addition to giving them thermal vision
    that can easily distinguish shapes and distance even in the total absence
    of light. Dangerous radiation and lasers tuned outside the range of visible
    light are also visible to the user. Nearby radio transmissions can be seen
    as if they were visual flares of color. The system cannot translate these
    transmissions, only alert the user to them.
