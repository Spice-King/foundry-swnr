    A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the slowtime window was
    installed in crisis responders and others reliant on split-second decision
    making. When engaged, the implants accelerate the user's cogitation speed
    by more than three thousand percent. While there is no corresponding
    acceleration of the user's physical reflexes, they have time to process the
    situation and take in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime window
    cannot be surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how
    unexpected the attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful on the
    tissues, however, and one point of System Strain is gained each time it is
    engaged.
