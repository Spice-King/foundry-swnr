    This cyberware involves micronized neural stimulation technology which is
    imperceptible to anything short of TL5 medical scanning or TL4 surgical
    examination of the subject's brain tissue. When active, the IST allows the
    subject to adopt a secondary persona, complete with a library of
    manufactured memories. So long as the IST is active, the subject will
    honestly and completely believe himself to be the secondary persona, a
    conviction that cannot be penetrated by telepathy or TL4 methods of
    interrogation. The persona can be activated at the user's discretion, but
    it only deactivates on a preset trigger, leaving the subject in full
    possession of all memories experienced.  The trigger can be any perceptible
    stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a specific person, a code phrase,
    or any other sign, and it may be changed by the user each time they activate
    the cyberware. Many ISTs are also implanted with a "master key" that will
    automatically deactivate the triggered identity.
