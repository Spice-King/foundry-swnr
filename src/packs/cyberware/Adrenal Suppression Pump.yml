    These endocrine pumps neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user when
    activated while exciting the user's perceptual centers. This combination
    produces a cold, dispassionate situational awareness that grants the user
    +2 on initiative rolls when the system is engaged. Most systems have
    built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain
    damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more than an hour each day. The
    user takes a -2 penalty on all social skill checks while the unit is
    active, and it requires five rounds to toggle it.
