    This broad-spectrum scrub system carefully identifies and contains toxic
    substances introduced into the user's system. Whenever the subject would
    normally have to make a saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they
    may instead gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save.
    Most of these systems are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins or
    chemicals in standard use by police or military forces in the sector, but
    if presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the filters are less
    effective. In such cases, the most it can do is either grant a second
    saving throw if the first is failed, or grant a single saving throw if none
    is normally allowed.
