  description: >-
    <p>The metapsion is capable of “hanging” a psychic power in their brain,
    forming the energy patterns and then suspending them in a self-sustaining
    loop until it’s time to trigger their release. The psychic must Commit
    Effort for the day to hang a power, along with the Effort normally necessary
    to trigger it. None of this Effort can be recovered until the power is
    expended, after which it recovers at its usual speed. Activating the power
    is an Instant action, or an On Turn action if it allows the target a saving
    throw of some kind. Only one ability can be held suspended at any one
    time.</p>
