    <p>The metapsion allows a hostile psychic into their mental sanctum in order
    to gain a later advantage. When targeted by a hostile psionic power that
    allows a save, the metapsion may Commit Effort as an Instant action and
    voluntarily fail the saving throw, accepting the effect. The next psychic
    power the user targets at that assailant then allows the victim no saving
    throw. This technique lasts until the metapsion makes their psychic attack
    or reclaims their Committed Effort. A hostile psychic may be affected by
    only one <em>Neural Trap</em> from a given psychic at a time</p>
