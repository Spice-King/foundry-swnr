    <p>The metapsion gains improved mastery over their own powers and an innate
    sensitivity to the use of psionic abilities in their
    presence.</p><p>Level-0: The adept can visually and audibly detect the use
    of psychic powers. If both the source and target are visible to the
    metapsion, they can tell who’s using the power, even if it’s normally
    imperceptible. They gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw versus a psionic
    power.</p><p>Level-1: The metapsion’s maximum Effort increases by an
    additional point.</p><p>Level-2: The adept can determine whether or not a
    person is a psychic or has latent psionic abilities through one round of
    visual inspection. Their saving throw bonus against psionic powers increases
    to +3.</p><p>Level-3: The metapsion’s maximum Effort increases by an
    additional point.</p><p>Level-4: The metapsion can perform a slightly safer
    version of torching. Instead of rolling the torching damage die, they simply
    suffer 10 hit points of damage after torching is used. The damage occurs
    after the fueled power activates, allowing a psychic at low hit points to
    trigger a power before falling unconscious. This damage cannot be healed by
    anything but natural bed rest, though a psychic can be stabilized if this
    technique drops her to zero hit points.</p>
