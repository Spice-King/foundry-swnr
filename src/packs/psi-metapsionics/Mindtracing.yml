    <p>The metapsion can trace back the use of psionic powers they’ve noticed in
    their presence. By Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant action,
    they can see and hear through the senses of a user of a psychic power,
    gaining an intuitive awareness of their location and treating them as a
    visible target for purposes of their own abilities. Thus, if they see
    someone being affected by a telepathy power with no visible source, they can
    use this ability to briefly share the hidden telepath’s senses. If used on a
    target that is teleporting, they can perceive the teleporter’s view of their
    destination. Use on a metamorphically-shaped impostor would reveal the
    biopsion responsible for the change, and so forth. These shared senses last
    for only one round and do not interfere with the adept’s other actions.</p>
