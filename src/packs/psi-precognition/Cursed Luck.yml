    <p>Negative probabilities are woven tightly around a visible animate target,
    including robots and animals but not including vehicles. Triggering this
    technique requires a Main Action and Committing Effort for the scene. The
    target must roll any attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving
    throws twice and take the worst result each time. Any attempts to hit the
    target or damage dice rolled against it may be rolled twice and the better
    result taken. Intelligent targets can make a Mental saving throw at the end
    of each round to throw off the effect; this save is not penalized by the
    power.</p>
