    <p>The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of their
    own future. Each invocation of the <em>Oracle</em> technique requires a Main
    Action and that the user Commit Effort for the day. Once triggered, the
    adept gets a single brief vision related to the question about the future
    that they’re asking. This vision is always from their own personal vantage
    point and never reveals more than a minute of insight, though the psychic
    processes it almost instantly as part of the power’s use.</p><p>The GM
    should answer the question as if the PC were about to perform the act or
    engage in the investigation pertinent to the question. Thus, if the adept
    wanted to know what pressing a button would do and the GM knows that it’s
    connected to a bomb, the psychic might get a vision of sudden death. If the
    bomb were on a time delay that extended past the time horizon of the oracle,
    however, the psychic might just see a vision of herself waiting patiently,
    with nothing happening.</p><p>Visions should relate to actions and events,
    not abstract facts. <em>Oracle</em> couldn’t tell a psychic who the crime
    boss of a slum neighborhood is, for example, but it could give a vision of
    the psychic caught in the next bloody riot and the gang boss who’s directing
    the myriad thugs. It couldn’t reveal the source: "precognition", name of a
    security guard, but it could show the seer the impending moment that the
    next guard patrol will enter the area the psychic plans to infiltrate. Only
    the most important or significant information is conveyed by the technique,
    even if multiple events of interest might transpire during the time
    horizon.</p><p><em>Oracle</em> can only be used on a given question or topic
    once until the situation changes substantially or a week goes by. The
    maximum time horizon of the <em>Oracle</em> increases as the adept’s
    Precognition skill improves.</p><p>Level-0: One minute into the
    future.</p><p>Level-1: One day into the future.</p><p>Level-2: One week into
    the future.</p><p>Level-3: Three months into the future.</p><p>Level-4: One
    year into the future.</p>
