    Your hero has received training in controlling their natural Metadimensional
    Extroversion Syndrome, and can wield the psychic powers that come from that
    strange affliction. Controlling and developing psychic abilities is an
    extremely demanding process but allows for feats wholly impossible to
    ordinary men and women.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychics are extremely
    rare in the general population. Averages vary with worlds, but most range
    from one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand who have the MES
    condition that make them amenable to psychic training. Some of these go
    their entire lives without realizing their capabilities. Others end up
    exploiting their native abilities without training, almost inevitably ending
    up seriously brain-damaged or crazed by the effects of unmediated
    metadimensional energy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hero has been
    fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or other training institution
    capable of molding and directing these abilities. They may have come to this
    later in life, or been recruited young by a society that carefully watches
    for MES symptoms.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some societies deal with their
    psychics more generously than others. On some worlds, psychic powers are
    accepted and their possessors can look forward to lucrative and respected
    employment. On others, fear of these uncanny powers and memories of the
    horrors of the Scream lead to less welcoming treatment.

      You are a restricted psychic. Pick one psychic discipline as a bonus skill
      at level-0. You can improve this skill with foci or skill points gained
      from advancing a level, but you cannot learn or improve any other psychic
      skill. Your maximum Effort equals 1 plus this psychic skill's level plus
      the best of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers, down to a minimum of 1.

      Every Psychic PC has certain special
      abilities.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Warriors or Experts, you are
      capable of learning psychic disciplines and their associated techniques,
      as described starting on page 28.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you
      pick this class, choose any two psychic skills as bonus skills. You can
      pick the same one twice to obtain level-1 proficiency in it and a free
      level-1 technique from that discipline.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
      have an Effort score, which can be used to fuel psychic abilities. Your
      maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus your highest psychic skill plus the
      better of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers. Even with a penalty, your
      maximum Effort cannot be lower than 1.
