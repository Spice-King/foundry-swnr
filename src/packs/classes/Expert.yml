    Your hero is exceptionally good at a useful skill. Doctors, cat burglars,
    starship pilots, grifters, technicians, or any other concept that focuses on
    expertise in a non-combat skill should pick the Expert class. Experts are
    the best at such skills and gain more of them than other classes
    do.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make
    a shot when the chips are down, an Expert has a knack for succeeding at the
    moments of greatest importance. Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a
    failed skill check, taking the new result if it's better. This benefit can
    be applied to any skill check, even those that the Expert isn't specially
    focused in. Their natural talent bleeds over into everything they
    do.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their chosen field, however, the Expert
    is exceptionally gifted. Aside from the free focus level that all PCs get at
    the start of the game, an Expert can choose an additional level in a
    non-combat focus related to their background. They can spend both of these
    levels on the same focus if they wish, thus starting the game with level 2
    in that particular knack.

      You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background.
      Most concepts will take <i>Specialist,</i> though <i>Diplomat, Starfarer,
      Healer,</i> or some other focus might suit better. Gain an extra skill
      point every time you gain a character level which can be spent on any
      non-psychic, non-combat skill.

      Every Expert PC has certain special
      abilities.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain a free level in a
      non-combat focus related to your background. Most concepts will take
      <i>Specialist</i> in their main skill, though <i>Diplomat, Starfarer,
      Healer,</i> or some other focus might suit better. You may not take a
      combat-oriented focus with this perk. In case of uncertainty, the GM
      decides whether or not a focus is
      permitted.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once per scene, you can reroll a
      failed skill check, taking the new roll if it's
      better.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you advance an experience level,
      you gain a bonus skill point that can be spent on any non-combat,
      non-psychic skill. You can save this point to spend later if you wish.
