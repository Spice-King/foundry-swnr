    Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder, gengineered combat hominid,
    or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk job, your hero
    has a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in <b><i>Stars Without
    Number</b></i> is extremely dangerous, but your hero has the talents to
    survive situations that would kill a less martial
    adventurer.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a gifted purveyor of violence,
    you get to pick an extra combat-related focus associated with your special
    brand of havoc. While a character of any class can take these special combat
    talents, you get this additional pick and a better natural hit bonus than
    heroes of other classes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly,
    however, Warriors have an uncanny gift for making a shot when a hit is
    desperately needed, or dodging a bullet when their life is on the line. Once
    per scene, a Warrior can either automatically negate a successful combat hit
    they just received, taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one of
    their own missed attack rolls into an automatic hit. This versatility makes
    Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and
    significantly more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general melee.

      Every Warrior PC has certain special abilities.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain a free level in a combat-related
      focus associated with your background. The GM decides if a focus qualifies
      if it's an ambiguous case.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors are lucky
      in combat. Once per scene, as an Instant ability, you can either choose to
      negate a successful attack roll against you or turn a missed attack roll
      you made into a successful hit. You can use this ability after the dice
      are rolled, but it cannot be used against environmental damage, effects
      without an attack roll, or hits on a vehicle you're occupying.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain two extra maximum hit points at each
      character level.
