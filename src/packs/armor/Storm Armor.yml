    Storm armor is a more advanced form of assault suit, one that can be
    fabricated only by those worlds that have retained some degree of
    Mandate-grade technical infrastructure. Aside from functioning as an assault
    suit, the storm armor’s exo-augments allow the wearer to treat their
    Strength as 4 points higher for encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic
    boosters allow the wearer to leap up to 20 meters as a Move action, either
    horizontally or vertically, and allow the wearer to fall up to 40 meters
    without suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch
    stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the wearer would
    normally die from an untreated mortal wound, they can make a Physical save
    to self-stabilize. Storm armor requires the same type B power cell as an
    assault suit, and each cell powers it for 24 hours.
