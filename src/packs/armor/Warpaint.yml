    Warpaint is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and scrap-built
    street harness of gangers, cult enforcers, street toughs, and other marginal
    sorts with little money but much need for protection. Most warpaint is
    fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4 materials that are exceptionally tough
    or rigid, filled out with gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and
    the usual threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly impractical but
    inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in warpaint that is meaningful to them
    gains a +1 Morale bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced together over years
    or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a finished suit comes at the
    listed price, assuming someone can be found willing to part with theirs.
