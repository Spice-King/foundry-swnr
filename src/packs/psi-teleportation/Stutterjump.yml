    <p>The psychic can instinctively micro-teleport away from incoming danger.
    As an On Turn action they may Commit Effort to begin shifting their spatial
    position away from attacks, gaining a base Armor Class of 20 so long as the
    Effort remains Committed. This Armor Class is not modified by armor,
    shields, or Dexterity modifiers, and the micro-jumps do not significantly
    move the psychic from their current location. While <em>Stutterjump</em> is
    active, as an Instant action the adept may Commit Effort for the day to
    negate a successful hit by a weapon attack, even after damage has been
    rolled. This reflexive defensive jump may be used only once per day and
    leaves the psychic just outside the radius of explosions or other
    area-effect attacks.</p>
