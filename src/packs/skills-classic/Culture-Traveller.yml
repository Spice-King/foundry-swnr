    This skill is unique in that it can only be taken at level 0 and cannot be
    raised. It can substitute for any other planet's Culture skill, however, and
    represents a casual, basic knowledge of many different worlds. This skill is
    useless on worlds that have been completely cut off from interstellar
    contact. Traveller skill grants no linguistic proficiency.
