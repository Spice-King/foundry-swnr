    Weaponless combat techniques. Unlike other forms of weaponry, a practitioner
    of unarmed combat can add their Combat/Unarmed skill to the damage roll as
    well as the hit roll. Characters with Unarmed-2 expertise are so good that
    they can even injure targets in powered armor and other gear that would
    otherwise prevent effective Unarmed attacks.
