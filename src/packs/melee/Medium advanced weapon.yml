  description: >-
    Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other obvious
    implements of war. While they can’t be effectively concealed in anything
    smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more damaging to an
    unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when
    the wielder needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar
    aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters. An advanced one has been
    given a monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a chainsaw blade,
    or some other TL4 touch. Advanced weapons can ignore primitive plate and
    hide protections.
