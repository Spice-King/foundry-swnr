  description: >-
    Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes, spears, or other obvious
    implements of war. While they can’t be effectively concealed in anything
    smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more damaging to an
    unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when
    the wielder needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar
    aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters. A primitive weapon is
    simply one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech augmentations.
    Primitive weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered armor.
