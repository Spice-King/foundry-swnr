  description: >-
    Large weapons are two-handed implements of bodily ruin such as claymores,
    halberds, tetsubos, or other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they rely
    largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash through lighter forms of
    armor. Large weapons count as two encumbrance items. An advanced one has
    been given a monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a chainsaw
    blade, or some other TL4 touch. Advanced weapons can ignore primitive plate
    and hide protections.
