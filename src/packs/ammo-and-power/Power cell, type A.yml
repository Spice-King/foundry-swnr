    Power cells: One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the
    Silence, power cells are small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold
    electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for personal equipment.
    The engineering for the cells is substantially different, and they cannot be
    exchanged or recharge each other without a trained tech’s modifications or a
    converter unit. Power cells can be recharged off a ship’s power plant or
    other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell
