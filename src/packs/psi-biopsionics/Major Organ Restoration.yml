    <p>The biopsion’s <em>Psychic Succor</em> can now cure congenital birth
    defects and regrow missing limbs and organs. It can even be used to
    stabilize targets that have been dropped by Heavy weapons, decapitated, or
    otherwise dramatically dismembered, provided it’s used within one round per
    level of Biopsionic skill. The best that can be done for such badly-mangled
    targets is stabilization, after which they must rest for 24 hours before any
    further hit points can be healed by Biopsionics, stims, or natural rest.</p>
