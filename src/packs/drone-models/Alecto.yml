    The Alecto model of drone examples one way that pretech scientists attempted
    to sidestep the limits of quantum ECM on the modern battlefield. Every
    Alecto is a full-fledged VI, an expert system so sophisticated as to seem
    almost sentient. Its self-reinforcing cognition allows it to operate even
