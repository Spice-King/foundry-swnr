  description: >-
    <p>The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a
    sentient target’s thoughts. The target must be visible or otherwise
    perceptible to the telepath’s unaided senses. Opening a contact requires the
    telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the contact
    lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other techniques.</p><p>The
    depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic’s Telepathy skill.
    A single contact can use any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath
    of the user’s skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for a saving
    throw, though more advanced probes allow the target to make a Mental saving
    throw to resist. On a successful save, no form of this technique that allows
    a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene.</p><p>Level-0: Observe
    emotional states in a target. Intense emotions provide a single word or
    image related to the focus of the feelings.</p><p>Level-1: A shallow gestalt
    with the target’s language centers allows the telepath to understand any
    form of communication made by the target. If the psychic has the requisite
    body parts to speak the target’s language, they can communicate with it in
    turn.</p><p>Level-2: The psychic’s awareness of the target’s surface
    cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts, though it
    can’t pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets a Mental
    saving throw to resist this.</p><p>Level-3: The psychic can drill down into
    the target’s memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to any single
    question they ask, or receive a single answering vision of the target’s
    recollections. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this
    power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It
    can be re-established, but only by activating this technique
    again.</p><p>Level-4: The psychic instantly gets a full and nuanced
    awareness of everything the target can remember about a particular topic.
    The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and
    whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended afterwards. It
    can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.</p>
