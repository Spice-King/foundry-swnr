        text: >-
          Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How complex will

        text: >-
          Convince others to also do whatever it is you’re trying to do. Talk
          might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make
          them do it even when they think it’s a bad idea. Roll it to lead
          troops in combat, convince others to follow you, or maintain morale
          and discipline.

      punch:
        name: Punch
        text: >-
          Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed. If your PC means to
          make a habit of this rather than as a recourse of desperation, you
          should take the Unarmed Combatant focus described later.
