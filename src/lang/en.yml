      administer:
        name: Administer
        text: >-
          Manage an organization, handle paperwork, analyze records, and keep an
          institution functioning on a daily basis. Roll it for bureaucratic
          expertise, organizational management, legal knowledge, dealing with
          government agencies, and understanding how institutions really work.
      connect:
        name: Connect
        text: >-
          Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get them to
          cooperate with you. Roll it to make useful connections with others,
          find people you know, know where to get illicit goods and services,
          and be familiar with foreign cultures and languages. You can use it in
          place of Talk for persuading people you find via this skill.
      exert:
        name: Exert
        text: >-
          Apply trained speed, strength, or stamina in some feat of physical
          exertion. Roll it to run, jump, lift, swim, climb, throw, and so
          forth. You can use it as a combat skill when throwing things, though
          it doesn’t qualify as a combat skill for other ends.
      fix:
        name: Fix
        text: >-
          Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How complex will
          depend on your character’s background; a lostworlder blacksmith is
          going to need some study time before he’s ready to fix that broken
          fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things,
          build things, and identify what something is supposed to do.
      heal:
        name: Heal
        text: >-
          Employ medical and psychological treatment for the injured or
          disturbed. Roll it to cure diseases, stabilize the critically injured,
          treat psychological disorders, or diagnose illnesses.
      know:
        name: Know
        text: >-
          Know facts about academic or scientific fields. Roll it to understand
          planetary ecologies, remember relevant history, solve science
          mysteries, and know the basic facts about rare or esoteric topics.
      lead:
        name: Lead
        text: >-
          Convince others to also do whatever it is you’re trying to do. Talk
          might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make
          them do it even when they think it’s a bad idea. Roll it to lead
          troops in combat, convince others to follow you, or maintain morale
          and discipline.
      notice:
        name: Notice
        text: >-
          Spot anomalies or interesting facts about your environment. Roll it
          for searching places, detecting ambushes, spotting things, and reading
          the emotional state of other people.
      perform:
        name: Perform
        text: >-
          Exhibit some performative skill. Roll it to dance, sing, orate, act,
          or otherwise put on a convincing or emotionally moving performance.
      pilot:
        name: Pilot
        text: >-
          Use this skill to pilot vehicles or ride beasts. Roll it to fly
          spaceships, drive vehicles, ride animals, or tend to basic vehicle
          repair. This skill doesn’t help you with things entirely outside the
          scope of your background or experience, though with some practice a PC
          can expand their expertise.
      program:
        name: Program
        text: >-
          Operating or hacking computing and communications hardware. Roll it to
          program or hack computers, control computer-operated hardware, operate
          communications tech, or decrypt things.
      punch:
        name: Punch
        text: >-
          Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed. If your PC means to
          make a habit of this rather than as a recourse of desperation, you
          should take the Unarmed Combatant focus described later.
      shoot:
        name: Shoot
        text: >-
          Use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry, whether hurled
          rocks, bows, laser pistols, combat rifles, or ship’s gunnery.
      sneak:
        name: Sneak
        text: >-
          Move without drawing notice. Roll it for stealth, disguise,
          infiltration, manual legerdemain, pickpocketing, and the defeat of
          security measures.
      stab:
        name: Stab
        text: >-
          Use it as a combat skill when wielding melee weapons, whether
          primitive or complex.
      survive:
        name: Survive
        text: >-
          Obtain the basics of food, water, and shelter in hostile environments,
          along with avoiding their natural perils. Roll it to handle animals,
          navigate difficult terrain, scrounge urban resources, make basic
          tools, and avoid wild beasts or gangs.
      talk:
        name: Talk
        text: >-
          Convince other people of the facts you want them to believe. What they
          do with that conviction may not be completely predictable. Roll it to
          persuade, charm, or deceive others in conversation.
      trade:
        name: Trade
        text: >-
          Find what you need on the market and sell what you have. Roll it to
          sell or buy things, figure out where to purchase hard-to-get or
          illicit goods, deal with customs agents, or run a business.
      work:
        name: Work
        text: >-
          This is a catch-all skill for professions not represented by other
          skills. Roll it to work at a particular profession, art, or trade
    wwn:
      administer:
        name: Administer
        text: >-
          Keep an organization running smoothly,
          scribe things well, plan out logistics, identify 
          incompetent or treacherous workers, analyze records
          or archives, or otherwise do things that an executive
          or middle-manager would need to do.
      connect:
        name: Connect
        text: >-
          Find or know people who are useful to your
          purposes, make friendships or social acquaintances,
          know who to talk to to get favors or services, and
          call on the help or resources of organizations you
          belong to. Connect covers your PC’s ability to find
          the people you need, though convincing them to
          help may require more than this.
      convince:
        name: Convince
        text: >-
          Persuade a listener that something you are
          saying is true. Naturally, the more implausible the
          claim or more emotionally repugnant it is to them,
          the more difficult it is to persuade them. Furthermore,
          how they act on their newfound conviction is
          up to them and their motivations, and may not be
          perfectly predictable.
      craft:
        name: Craft
        text: >-
          Craft or repair goods and technology appropriate to the PC’s background and society. The Craft
          skill can be used for a wide range of artisan pursuits,
          though a GM is within their rights to keep the PC
          from building complex things that are too far away
          from their past background and experience.
      exert:
        name: Exert
        text: >-
          Run, swim, climb, jump, labor for long periods,
          throw things, or otherwise exert your physical
          strength, stamina, and coordination. Even a PC
          with poor physical attributes might have a good
          Exert skill reflecting athletic training and expertise
          in making the most of their available talents.
      heal:
        name: Heal
        text: >-
          Treat wounds, cure diseases, neutralize poisons,
          diagnose psychological health issues,
          and otherwise tend to the wounds of body and mind. The
          Heal skill cannot cure lost hit points directly, but it’s
          a vital skill in stabilizing Mortally Wounded allies
          or ensuring clean recovery from grievous injuries.
      know:
        name: Know
        text: >-
          Know matters of history, geography, natural science, zoology,
          and other academic fields appropriateto a sage or scholar. 
          While some sages might specialize in particular fields,
          most learned men and women in this age have a broad range of understanding,
          and will rarely be unable to even attempt to answer
          a question relevant to this skill.
      lead:
        name: Lead
        text: >-
          Inspire others to follow your lead and believe in
          your plans and goals. Manage subordinates and
          keep them focused, loyal, and motivated in the face
          of danger or failure. A successful leader will keep
          their subordinate’s faith and confidence even when
          reason might make the leader’s plan appear questionable at best.
      magic:
        name: Magic
        text: >-
          Cast or analyze magic and know things about
          famous mages or notable magical events. Classes
          that can’t cast spells obtain only intellectual and
          scholarly benefits from this skill.
      notice:
        name: Notice
        text: >-
          Notice small details, impending ambushes, hidden features, or concealed objects. Detect subtle
          smells, sounds, or other sensory input. Notice cannot be used simply to detect a lie, but keen attention
          can often discern a subject’s emotional state.
      perform:
        name: Perform
        text: >-
          Sing, act, dance, orate, or otherwise perform
          impressively for an audience. Compose music, plays,
          writings, or other works of performance art. Most
          performers will have a particular field they excel
          at, though polymaths might exist if the PC’s background is appropriate for such versatility.
      pray:
        name: Pray
        text: >-
          Perform the clerical rites of your religion, and be
          familiar with the gods, demons, and taboos of major and minor faiths, and identify iconography and
          persons of religious importance. Pray also helps you
          know the state of local faiths and the important persons in their hierarchies.
      punch:
        name: Punch
        text: >-
          Fight unarmed or with natural body weaponry.
          Punch, kick, grapple, or otherwise brawl without
          the benefit of man-made tools. This mode of fighting
          is inefficient at best without some special Focus
          to improve it, but it’s reliably non-lethal.
      ride:
        name: Ride
        text: >-
          Ride an animal, drive a cart or carriage, or otherwise deal with land transportation. This skill also
          includes competence at mount care and tending,
          basic cart or carriage repair, judging good horse-flesh, and other skills appropriate to a beast-rider
          of whatever society the PC comes from.
      sail:
        name: Sail
        text: >-
          Sail or repair a ship, build small craft, navigate by
          the stars, read sea weather, manage sailors, and 
          otherwise conduct the business of a professional mariner. 
          This skill may apply to more esoteric means of
          vehicular travel in some societies.
      shoot:
        name: Shoot
        text: >-
          Fire a bow or crossbow or throw a hurled weapon.
          Maintain ranged weaponry and fletch arrows.
      sneak:
        name: Sneak
        text: >-
          Move silently, hide in shadows, avoid notice, pick
          pockets, disguise yourself, pick locks, defeat traps,
          or otherwise overcome security measures.
      stab:
        name: Stab
        text: >-
          Fight with melee weapons or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain and identify weaponry.
      survive:
        name: Survive
        text: >-
          Hunt, fish, navigate by the stars, mitigate environmental 
          hazards, identify plants and wildlife, and
          craft basic survival tools and shelter. A PC’s Survive
          skill is most pertinent to the environments in their
          background, but the basic principles can be applied
          in all but the most alien environments.
      trade:
        name: Trade
        text: >-
          Buy and sell at a profit, identify the worth of
          goods or treasures, deal with merchants and traders, 
          find black-market goods and services, and know
          laws regarding smuggling and contraband.
      work:
        name: Work
        text: >-
          This skill is a catch-all for any profession that
          might not otherwise merit its own skill, such as a
          painter, lawyer, farmer, or herdsman. The precise
          skill it represents will vary with the PC’s background.
