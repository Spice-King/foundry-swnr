      administer:
        name: Administer
        text: >-
          Manage an organization, handle paperwork, analyze records, and keep an
          institution functioning on a daily basis. Roll it for bureaucratic
          expertise, organizational management, legal knowledge, dealing with
          government agencies, and understanding how institutions really work.
      connect:
        name: Connect
        text: >-
          Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get them to
          cooperate with you. Roll it to make useful connections with others,
          find people you know, know where to get illicit goods and services,
          and be familiar with foreign cultures and languages. You can use it in
          place of Talk for persuading people you find via this skill.
      exert:
        name: Exert
        text: >-
          Apply trained speed, strength, or stamina in some feat of physical
          exertion. Roll it to run, jump, lift, swim, climb, throw, and so
          forth. You can use it as a combat skill when throwing things, though
          it doesn’t qualify as a combat skill for other ends.
      fix:
        name: Fix
        text: >-
          Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How complex will
          depend on your character’s background; a lostworlder blacksmith is
          going to need some study time before he’s ready to fix that broken
          fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things,
          build things, and identify what something is supposed to do.
      heal:
        name: Heal
        text: >-
          Employ medical and psychological treatment for the injured or
          disturbed. Roll it to cure diseases, stabilize the critically injured,

        text: >-
          Know facts about academic or scientific fields. Roll it to understand
          planetary ecologies, remember relevant history, solve science
          mysteries, and know the basic facts about rare or esoteric topics.
      lead:
        name: Lead
        text: >-
          Convince others to also do whatever it is you’re trying to do. Talk
          might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make
          them do it even when they think it’s a bad idea. Roll it to lead
          troops in combat, convince others to follow you, or maintain morale
          and discipline.
      notice:
        name: Notice
        text: >-
          Spot anomalies or interesting facts about your environment. Roll it

          the emotional state of other people.

        text: >-
          Exhibit some performative skill. Roll it to dance, sing, orate, act,
          or otherwise put on a convincing or emotionally moving performance.
      pilot:

        text: >-
          Use this skill to pilot vehicles or ride beasts. Roll it to fly
          spaceships, drive vehicles, ride animals, or tend to basic vehicle
          repair. This skill doesn’t help you with things entirely outside the
          scope of your background or experience, though with some practice a PC
          can expand their expertise.
      program:
        name: Program
        text: >-
          Operating or hacking computing and communications hardware. Roll it to
          program or hack computers, control computer-operated hardware, operate
          communications tech, or decrypt things.
      punch:
        name: Punch
        text: >-
          Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed. If your PC means to
          make a habit of this rather than as a recourse of desperation, you
          should take the Unarmed Combatant focus described later.
      shoot:
        name: Shoot

          Use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry, whether hurled

          Use it as a combat skill when wielding melee weapons, whether
          primitive or complex.

        name: Survive
        text: >-
          Obtain the basics of food, water, and shelter in hostile environments,
          along with avoiding their natural perils. Roll it to handle animals,
          navigate difficult terrain, scrounge urban resources, make basic
          tools, and avoid wild beasts or gangs.
      talk:
        name: Talk
        text: >-
          Convince other people of the facts you want them to believe. What they
          do with that conviction may not be completely predictable. Roll it to
          persuade, charm, or deceive others in conversation.
      trade:
        name: Trade
        text: >-
          Find what you need on the market and sell what you have. Roll it to
