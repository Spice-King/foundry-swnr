# Git 2.23 (August 2019) added this feature to it's blame subcommand to 
# ignore commits via a file and a config option to default which file to
# use.
#
# This file will contain a list of commits that are probably not what is
# being looked for in a blame, like mass renaming or reformatting. All
# commit refs should have a comment above it describing what and why the
# commit is in the list and a blank line between them. To save typing
# out the flag, you can set the default file via the following command
# for the repo.
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# mass reformat for inforcing base eslint/prettier rules.
